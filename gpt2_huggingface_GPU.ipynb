In the background, there sounded the faintest rustle. When he perceived it, Ukridge spun round and looked inquiringly at the object of his search—the proprietor of the shop. “Who wants the new car?” inquired the proprietor, in tones of friendly interest. Ukridge’s face resumed its expressionless stolidity. He seemed to regard me as something quite ordinary and uninteresting which he could invite to browse among his sundry wares. “What colour is that, Ukridge?” demanded the proprietor. You would mistake it for a rose, I suppose.” It might have been a rose, Ukridge supposed; but his eyes narrowed, as he contemplated the peculiar shape of one of those roses.\n",
            "Ukridge was in the street in front of Selfridge’s shop. Standing among a growing collection of elderly artists, he perceived me, as I entered, as a trifle dishevelled—a fact which, he, as we shook hands awkwardly, was due to the cold weather and the closeness of the hour, for I had only just returned from Oxford Street at the hour when women come up from the suburbs to shop; and he was standing among the dogs and commissionaires outside Selfridge’s. In the background, there sounded the faintest rustle. When he perceived it, Ukridge spun round and looked inquiringly at the object of his search—the proprietor of the shop. “Who wants the new car?” inquired the proprietor, in tones of friendly interest. Ukridge’s face resumed its expressionless stolidity. He seemed to regard me as something quite ordinary and uninteresting which he could invite to browse among his sundry wares. “What colour is that, Ukridge?” demanded the proprietor. You would mistake it for a rose, I suppose.” There was a pause of some moments, during which Ukridge looked out of the window, stared a little blankly in perplexity into space, and finally spoke. “What colour is that, Mr. Ukridge?” “Oh, that was the colour of my hair.” Ukridge hesitated for a moment, then, with that peculiar delicacy of which he is so notoriously capable, uttered at a venture the words “You know me,” and waved me down with a sort of paternal gravity; for Ukridge, though he knew not me, was certainly a man of action. That night, at dinner, he had shown a tendency to sit up quite late, and he did so again now. It was, he told me, because he seemed to be dying to see his niece, whom he had not seen much of since her arrival, appear unexpectedly in person. He was feeling aggrieved and baffled.
